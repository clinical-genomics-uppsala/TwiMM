# Introduction

The TwiMM pipeline is a bioinformatic pipeline designed to analyse targeted long-read (PacBio) sequencing data for the multiple myeloma gene panel. 
It is built using Snakemake and the [hydra-genetics](https://github.com/hydra-genetics/hydra-genetics) framework for efficient data processing and analysis.
