# TwiMM pipeline

**This project is under active development** :smiley:

The TwiMM pipeline is a bioinformatic pipeline designed to analyse targeted long-read (PacBio) sequencing data for the multiple myeloma gene panel.
It reports small variants, CNVs, SVs and translocations as well as QC metrics and plots.
It is built using Snakemake and the [hydra-genetics](https://github.com/hydra-genetics/hydra-genetics) framework for efficient data processing and analysis.
