# Twist Myeloma pipeline

**This project is under active development** :smiley:

The Twist Myeloma pipeline is a bioinformatic pipeline designed to analyse hybrid capture long-read (PacBio) sequencing data from the multiple myeloma gene panel.
It reports small variants, CNVs, SVs and translocations (under development) as well as QC metrics and plots.
It is built using Snakemake and the [hydra-genetics](https://github.com/hydra-genetics/hydra-genetics) framework for efficient data processing and analysis.
